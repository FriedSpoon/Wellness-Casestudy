      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>[<span>Concept</span> - waterwell is an wellness app that's main purpose is to help track water consumption throughout
      the day. The user is able to set how much water they want to drink daily, and be able to input the amount as
      they drink it. Key emphasis was put on how the app flowed and if everything made sense. It seeks to solve the problem of a finding a water tracking app that is simple.]
      </p>
    
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>[<span>Task</span> -To create a wellness app that will help someone improve a specific area in their life.
      With a key focus on text hierarchy, dashboard layout, and the removal of user frustration points.]
      </p>
  
   
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>[<span>My Approach</span> - A lot of thought went towards the user and how they would interact with the app, with 
      a clear goal in removing as many frustration points as possible. Emphasis was placed on user flows, and 
      making sure the certain actions made sense instead of having the user learn new ways to do things.]

      <h1>Target User</h1>
      <p>[<span>Target User</span> - The user for this group is those who wish to track their water intake throughout the day, because for 
      many this can be challenging, but the specific user of this app wanted an app that mostly focused on water intake
      without any corny addons.]

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <div class="research">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I looked at various examples of wellness apps such as, bettersleep, Calm, and water tracking apps. Most of my research involved data on what made a interface usable, and pleasant to use without any major frustrations on the users end. I took away that an over complicated naviagtion bar may look good, however that doesn't mean it functions well. I also looked applied some user thumb patterns into my design.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="interviews">
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>
        The results from my interview came back as such:
        An app that was easy and simple to use without any added clutter was required. The app would be for water tracking, and wouldn't have corny notifications such as "girl power" or things along the likes of that. Questions on current apps used by the user resulting in the answer, MyFitness Pal. I looked up plenty of apps related to water tracking and noticed they all had exact what the user DIDN'T want so I took note of that.

      <h1>Relection</h1>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>What was difficult about this project? What were some obstacles? A major difficulty in this project was simply the lack of many water tracking apps and finding a layout that made sense for the goal of the app. I also had small issues with XD transitioning effects and animations, for some reason the time transition was being painful.</p>
      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <p>Overall I feel like the layout works as intended and make sense as a water tracking app. I also enjoy the animations I included and the app icon in a real world scenario on an iphone screen, along with notifications.</p>
